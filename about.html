                <p>
                    In 1997 ODL developed the first blinds between insulated glass panels (BBGs), which were
                    installed primarily in residential entry doors. In 2016 ODL launched between glass blinds for
                    windows, which are now sold to a range of large and small window OEMs. These blinds are manually
                    controlled today. Historically energy performance has been characterized by U-factor and SHGC
                    metrics. With the establishment of the Attachments Energy Rating Council (AERC) the DOE has
                    supported studies assessing the whole
                    building energy savings of attached window coverings, specifically cellular shades and
                    horizontal blinds. These studies do not account for blind slat angle control which allow for
                    direct or diffuse solar radiation while providing natural daylight. There are no comparable
                    studies for BBGs and other forms of dynamic glazing. The DOE also sponsored studies of the
                    effectiveness of different window covering control strategies, anticipating the use of automated
                    window coverings in smart homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the first ENERGY STAR&reg; Smart Home
                    Energy Management System (SHEMS)
                    specification. AERC certified automated window coverings are listed as an “encouraged” optional
                    device. There was pushback against including ENERGY STAR windows with dynamic glazing,
                    specifically BBGs, based on the belief that the ENERGY STAR windows rating does not address
                    dynamic glass and that there is no connected criteria for windows.

                <h3>Objective of this Dashboard</h3>
                <p>Simulations were done in EnergyPlus (v 9.2) using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
                    prototype residential building that was modified by the AERC. The locations included a cold climate
                    (Minneapolis, MN) and a hot climate (Houston, TX).
                </p>

                <div class="container text-center">
                    <img src="static/images/prototype.png" / width="600">
                </div>

                <p>
                    Simulations were done for unshaded windows, windows with BBGs and Venetian blinds with slat angles
                    between -75 and 75 degrees at increments of 15 degrees, and windows with 3 types of cellular blinds.
                    The insulating class units (IGUs) where specific for each climate, including window systems that
                    meet
                    the ENERGY STAR requirements for that location.
                </p>

                <p>The EnergyPlus simulation results were compiled in using Python/Pandas and then formatted for export.
                    Exported data was used in Tableau to create visualizations specific for this project. The
                    visualizations are intended to look at both the energy impacts of shading devices and the
                    impacts of natural daylighting. Daylighting and illumnance data was recorded at a reference point
                    on the south elevation, 36 inches from the exterior wall and 30 inches from the floor. The
                    visualizations are intended to display the trade-offs on the insulating values of shading devices
                    compared the availability of natural light.
